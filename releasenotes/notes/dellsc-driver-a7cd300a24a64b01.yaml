  - Added Dell EMC SC multipath support
    This change implements the documented best practice to use multipath
    with a Cinder deployment by setting a Cinder configuration setting
    to ensure that multipath is appropriately used by the Dell EMC
    SC iSCSI driver. Multipath is true by default.
