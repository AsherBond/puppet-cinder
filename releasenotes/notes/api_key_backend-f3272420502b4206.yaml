    keymgr_api_class is now deprecated in favor of keymgr_backend, with
    full backward compatibility for users.
    keymgr_backend is set to cinder.keymgr.conf_key_mgr.ConfKeyManager
    by default and configure key_manager/backend instead of
    key_manager/api_class. It reflects what openstack/cinder did in Queens
    cycle.
