upgrade:
  - |
    The iscsi_ip_address parameter is no longer supported, and has been
    replaced by a corresponding target_ip_address parameter. This is due
    to cinder's removal of support for the iscsi_ip_address option during
    the Stein cycle.
deprecations:
  - |

    removed from cinder during the Stein cycle.
